# Biological and scientific structures

Read this when illustrating a cell, tissue mechanism, organelle, molecule, or other real scientific structure. Use `quality-bar.md` for the visual review. A biological figure is a schematic physical specimen, not a metaphorical factory or a clinical atlas.

## Build the specimen, not the stand

- Start with the real enclosing form. Give a cell an irregular curved membrane and a continuous volume of cytoplasm, not a circular base plate or a flat floor.
- Place structures at varied depths in that volume. Show posterior structures behind anterior ones and cut the enclosure deliberately to reveal the teaching target.
- Use continuous rounded profiles for membrane-bound bodies. Flattened cisternae still have rounded ends and enclosed lumens; they are not shelves or metal slabs.
- Model only intentional cut surfaces. Give each exposed lumen a distinct inner surface and a continuous boundary. Do not add openings that could be mistaken for a normal feature.
- Keep the kit's restrained tones, real occlusion, fine linework, and soft shadows. Change geometry before adding gradients, colour, or effects.
- Use colour sparingly for a persistent scientific distinction or one active process. Keep a stable mapping and explain it. Do not assign each organelle a decorative rainbow colour.

Use a detailed overview and a focus pose for important internal structures. An organelle rendered three pixels wide is not a useful explanation of its internal membrane.

## Choose purposeful detail

For a typical nucleated animal cell, a useful parts inventory includes:

| Structure | Recognisable detail | Relationship to preserve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plasma membrane | Thin bilayer, embedded proteins, an intentional cut rim | A flexible boundary around cytoplasm, not a rigid wall |
| Nucleus | Double envelope, pore complexes, chromatin, nucleolus | Outer envelope continuous with ER; nuclear and cytoplasmic spaces distinct |
| Rough ER | Connected flattened cisternae with ribosomes on their cytosolic faces | Translation and entry into the ER lumen occur at a membrane interface |
| Smooth ER | Branching, interconnected tubules without attached ribosomes | Continuity with the ER network |
| Golgi | Curved, enclosed cisternae, distinguishable receiving and shipping faces | ER-derived cargo enters the cis side; sorting occurs at the trans network |
| Mitochondrion | Outer membrane, folded inner membrane, matrix | Cristae are continuous inner-membrane folds, not detached zigzag marks |
| Lysosome | Enclosed lumen and material being degraded | Degradation occurs inside a membrane-delimited acidic compartment |
| Peroxisome | Enclosed oxidative compartment | Do not depict it as a duplicate lysosome or invent a universal crystalline core |
| Ribosomes | Two-subunit form or appropriately scaled surface dots | Free and ER-bound ribosomes are the same translation machinery |
| Cytoskeleton | Microtubules, actin and intermediate-filament patterns as needed | Networks support shape and transport; a radial fan alone is not the entire cytoskeleton |

Select details that distinguish the subject and teach its function. Do not use fixed organelle counts, sizes, or positions as biological data. Explain simplifications and special-cell exceptions only when relevant.

## Animate transformations and boundaries

Before animating, write a state sequence and draw a representative still for each state. Drive the caption, structure emphasis, carrier shape, and material position from one model.

For production and secretion of a soluble protein:

1. Show transcription and RNA processing in the nucleus. Keep DNA in the nucleus.
2. Show processed mRNA crossing a nuclear pore. Do not draw a protein or a transport vesicle coming out of the nucleus in its place.
3. Show a ribosome translating the message. An ER-targeting signal in the nascent chain directs the complex to the rough ER; depict translation into its lumen.
4. Show a polypeptide becoming a folded cargo representation in the ER. Distinguish the transcript from the newly made protein.
5. Show an ER-derived carrier budding with cargo inside its lumen. Hide the cargo from the cytosol.
6. Show delivery to the cis Golgi and processing/sorting towards the trans side. State when a simplified model omits intermediate compartments or recycling traffic.
7. Show a secretory carrier dock at the plasma membrane.
8. Show fusion as a change in membrane continuity and release of soluble cargo to extracellular space.

Do not move one unchanged marker across these stages and call it a mechanistic explanation. Do not infer measured transport paths, durations, energy consumption, or particle counts from the teaching sequence.

## Scientific verification

Use authoritative, original scientific sources for unfamiliar or consequential claims. Keep source identifiers or URLs alongside the relevant model descriptions. Separate established structure/function from deliberate visual simplifications.

For mechanical figures, retain the original support, terminal, clearance, and depth audits. For biological geometry, use checks that describe the actual tissue/compartment model: intentional contacts and shared boundaries, interior containment, cut-surface continuity, layer order, and carrier cargo containment. Do not falsely pass an engineering audit using substitute shapes, and do not label an unrun audit as passed.

Inspect overview, focus poses, and representative process states at normal size and at 4×. Correct a scientifically misleading silhouette even when the numbers and code are valid.

## Limits of the bundled specimen

The animal-cell example illustrates a schematic presentation approach. Its model checks do not prove cargo containment, membrane continuity, accurate targeting, or phase-boundary continuity. Before reuse, inspect those properties separately. Never infer scientific validity from its inclusion in the skill. Record the sources and any omitted pathways for the actual requested subject using `accuracy.md`.

## Molecular assemblies: do not turn proteins into labelled cylinders

For molecular motors, preserve the assembly hierarchy: membrane-spanning elements, anchored interfaces, central rotating elements, peripheral stationary supports, and catalytic domains. Organic volumes may be schematic but should look connected, occupy coherent depth and suggest real subunit organization rather than a few generic coloured extrusions. The archived `examples/atp-synthase/atp-synthase.html` demonstrates a user-preferred approach to cutaway and part inspection. Study its **craft** with `references/atp-benchmark.md`; validate all scientific structure and kinetics separately. A picture of three colored cylinders marked O/L/T can explain a cycle but does not substitute for a requested protein cutaway.

## Geometry before selectors

The supplied cell's static art was rendered and inspected during the gallery comparison. Its cytosol is represented by a broad horizontal cut-plane path; many organelles are shallow extrusions above it. This reads as objects on a tray despite the rounded lower shell. A large menu and more descriptions cannot repair that geometry.

For a new figure, establish the specimen volume and a deliberate sectional opening first. Render organelles at meaningful varied depths, with rounded enclosing surfaces and real lumen interiors. Define each process interface in world coordinates and share those coordinates with both static and moving geometry. Reserve back/front layers or split moving pieces as needed; appending every process path after all organelles puts cargo in front of structures it should pass behind.

For budding or fusion, show the boundary itself opening, joining or separating as justified by the subject; a circle growing next to an unchanged surface is only a symbol. If using a schematic symbol, label it and do not describe the topology as physically modelled. Inspect the action at its interface in a useful detail view before building the remaining stages. More stage names do not create a more complete mechanism.
